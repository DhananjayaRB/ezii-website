  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Is there a grace period for payment? What happens to my data after my subscription has ended?",
    answer: "There is no grace period for non-payment, and we do not offer auto-renewal. The features within the application will automatically disable once the expiry date is reached, and you will only have access to reports. Currently, report access is perpetual but may change in the future."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "How would changes in employee headcount affect my subscription and how would this be managed?",
    answer: "Once the payment is made, no refund is provided in the case of a reduction in headcount. However, during your subscription renewal, you can reduce your headcount, but not midway through your billing cycle. Increasing headcount is simple via the subscription management module, with charges based on the number of months remaining in your billing cycle. For example, if you've paid for 30 employees for the period April 1st â€“ June 30th and add 5 employees on May 15th, you will only be charged for the additional 5 employees in June, though they will have access starting May 15th."
